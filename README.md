# Replication: 
## Juhn, Murphy & Pierce (1991) and Neal & Johnson (1996)

This repository contains Stata code for replicating key results from:

- **Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991)** â€” *Accounting for the Slowdown in Black-White Wage Convergence*, AER  
- **Neal and Johnson (1996)** â€” *The Role of Premarket Factors in Black-White Wage Differences*, JPE

## What This Repository Does

- Recreates key tables and regression results from both studies
- Documents assumptions, data sources, and Stata commands used
- Follows the original authors' methodology as closely as possible

## How to Run the Code

To replicate the results:

1. Open Stata
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder (`JMP1991/do_files/` or `NJ1996/do_files/`).
3. Run the main `.do` file:

``` stata
do JMP_Replication.do
```

Or for Neal & Johnson:

``` stata
do NJ_Replication_BM.do
```


## Note: 
While the data is publicly available, it is not saved in these files.
